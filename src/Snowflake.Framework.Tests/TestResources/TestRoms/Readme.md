# Test ROMs

The ROMs contained here for testing purposes were ascertained to be freely distributable but not necessarily open source. Regardless, efforts have been made to ensure that they are non-commercial or otherwise distributable without liability. If you wish for a file to be removed from the repository, please file an issue and it will be taken care of as soon as possible.

# ROM Headers
The following files were created from backups of commercially available ROM files with all non header data removed from the ROM. Since little if any copyrighted game data still exists in these files, they are redistributed here for testing purposes. Obviously, none of these ROM files will run in any emulator or hardware, since all game data has been removed. This was only used as a final resort when freely available homebrew ROMs were not suitable for header confirmation purposes. These files contain **no** non-redistributable data, only serials, hashes, and titles that were part of the ROM header; no ROM data is included.
