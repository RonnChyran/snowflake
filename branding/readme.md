The badge logo is provided in three variants: *gradient*, *white*, and *black* in a variety of different sizes.

#### Guidelines

* **DO** Use the *gradient* variant whenever possible.
* **DO** Use the *white* varient if a colour-neutral design is required.
* **DO** Recolor the logo in a **solid** colour if absolutely necessary.
* **DO NOT** Use the *black* varieat except against stark white (`#fff`).
* **DO NOT** Apply any gradient besides the provided *gradient* variant.

### The *Banner Logo*

#### Description
The banner logo is the *gradient* variant of badge logo with the wordmark "SNOWFLAKE" written in uppercase typeset in *FF DIN Round Pro Light*. The text is coloured in **Dark Grey**, or **Off-white** in the *inverted* variant.

#### Guidelines

* **DO** Use the banner logo whenever possible, over the badge logo.

* **DO NOT** Recolor any elements of the logo. The badge logo in the banner must always be the *gradient* variant.
